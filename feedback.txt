Hi Naama!

I loved your doctor's appointments project! It's functional, it's logical, and user-friendly.

- A good practice would be to put all your application inside the App component and the App inside the index.js.
I've noticed you're not using your App component.

- I love your use of components, it's very clear and concise. 

- Your filing system works fantastic, the server.js file is accurate and the requests to the db are simple and short.

- Make sure to remove tests and console logs. I appreciate the use of comments!! :)

- Let me see your css skills in your final project

Overall, your project is really good, well displayed and user-friendly.

Well done!
